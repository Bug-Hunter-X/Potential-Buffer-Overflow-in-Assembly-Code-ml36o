This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in assembly code. The file `bug.asm` demonstrates the unsafe memory access, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with bounds checking.  This is a common error in low-level programming that can lead to security risks and program crashes.  The solution focuses on adding explicit checks to ensure that the memory access is within the bounds of the allocated buffer.
